I was interested in understanding campaign finance and voter turnout in US presidential elections. Here is an attempt at breaking down and analyzing the complex topics.
 
   * [election_financing.md](election_financing.md): The 2020 US presidential race has been unusual in many aspects including the unprecedented spending on campaign ads. This repo takes a closer look at personal and public donations to finance campaigns of all democrat as well as republican candidates as of January 31, 2020.

   * [election_turnout.md](election_turnout.md): I was curious about voter turnout behavior in the US. Given that voting is the corner stone of democracy, how many people practice the right earned through numerous sacrifices? This workbook reveals that the number mostly staggers at the 60\% mark, lower than desirable.
