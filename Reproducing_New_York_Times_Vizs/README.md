# Reproducing_New_York_Times_Vizs

As an avid New York Times reader, I commend the paper's use of data and high quality visualizations that tell impactful stories. This repo contains some of the visualizations I reproduced from different articles I found to be intriguing.

# Outline
1. **[reproducing_fed_rate_plot.html](https://tatesfaye.github.io/ttesfaye_data_science_projects/Reproducing_New_York_Times_Vizs/reproducing_fed_rate_plot.html)**:  In August 2020, the economic writer, Jeanna Smialek, published [an article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/business/economy/federal-reserve-inflation-jerome-powell.html) in the New York Times detailing the Fed's plan to deal with unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. [The article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/business/economy/federal-reserve-inflation-jerome-powell.html) explained how the Federal Reserve is taking an unusual approach to prioritize strong labor markets over lower inflation rates. This visualization reproduces the historical data on interest rates.

This document reproduces a subset of that work.
