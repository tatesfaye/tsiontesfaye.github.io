# COVID-19 Projects

As our newsfeed lately is inundated by COVID-19 related stories, I wanted to take unique perspectives and analyze the mico as well as macro impacts of the pandemic. This repo contains such projects.

* [covid_most_affected_as_of_jul26.pptx](COVID-19/covid_most_affected_as_of_jul26.pptx): I scraped the website: www.worldometers.info to study countries in the world most affected by the pandemic. [covid_most_affected_data_scrape.html](COVID-19/covid_most_affected_data_scrape.html) illustrates the process of harvesting the data while [covid_most_affected_as_of_jul26.twbx](COVID-19/covid_most_affected_as_of_jul26.twbx) shows the Tableau visualization and analysis of this data. This analysis reveals that Peru and Chile have alarming death rates. The citizen's dependence on frequent informal markets and the economid divide as speculated as potential reasons respectively. See [this BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-53150808) detailing Peru's circumstance and [this KPBS article](https://www.kpbs.org/news/2020/jul/02/covid-19-exploits-cracks-in-chilean-society/) exploring Chile.

* [covid_social_distancing_vs_poverty_dssg.html](COVID-19/covid_social_distancing_vs_poverty_dssg.html): The statistician, Paul Rosenbaum, proposes the concept of Elaborate Theories where he argues, " when constructing a causal hypothesis one should envisage as many different consequences of its truth as possible and plan observational studies to discover whether each of these consequences is found to hold." This notebook will implement Elaborate Theories to investigate our hypothesis that poorer counties are more prone lower social distancing since its citizens are more likely to have essential jobs which require them to travel even during the COVID-19 pandemic.
