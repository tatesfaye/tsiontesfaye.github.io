## Outline

* **[Reproducing_New_York_Times_Vizs](https://tatesfaye.github.io/ttesfaye_data_science_projects/Reproducing_New_York_Times_Vizs/)**: As an avid New York Times reader, I commend the paper's use of data and high quality visualizations that tell impactful stories. This repo contains some of the visualizations I reproduced from different articles I found to be intriguing. 

  + [Reproducing_opportunity_atlas_article_2018.Rmd](https://github.com/tatesfaye/ttesfaye/blob/master/Reproducing_New_York_Times_Vizs/reproducing_opportunity_atlas_article_2018.Rmd): In 2018, the New York Times published a compelling visualization showing how some neighborhoods facilitate the upward economic mobility of kids while others shackle it. This document reproduces a subset of that work.
